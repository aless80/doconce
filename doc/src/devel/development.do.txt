TITLE: Getting Started with Development

DocOnce is an open source project. 
The aim of this guide is to help getting started with development. It describes the program's structure and how to set up a script that runs DocOnce from a Python IDE.

======= The entry point `bin/doconce` =======
The entry point of the doconce program is the file `bin/doconce`. In fact, the `setup.py` file contains this line invoking the `scripts` option to run commands from terminal:

!bc pycod-t
setup(...,
  scripts = ['bin/doconce'],
)
!ec

Read more about `setup.py` on this page: "setuptools": "https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/setupscript.html#installing-scripts"

The `main` function in `/bin/doconce` starts processing the `doconce` command and sends it to different scripts. 

Any `doconce format` command is passed to the `format()` function, which in turn calls `format_driver()` in `lib/doconce/doconce.py`. 

The `doconce format --help` command is passed help_format(). Other commands including undefined ones are handled locally. 

Most of the commands are handled by the `eval` function: 

!bc pycod-t
retval = eval(command + '()')
!ec

which passes execution to specific function that are imported in the beginning of the script.


======= Python scripts in `lib/doconce/` =======

The `lib/doconce/` directory contains the scripts to run DocOnce. The name of the files give a clue about their purpose, e.g. `html.py` contains code that is run by `doconce format html`. The `doconce.py` file contains important formatting functions such as `doconce_format()`, `preprocess()`, `doconce2format()`, `file2file()`. 


I suggest navigating through the scripts by using an IDE with debugger. See the 
Section ref{section:IDE}.


======= Running in a IDE =======
label{section:IDE}

The following code can be used in a IDE such as "PyCharm": "https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/", "Eclipse": "https://www.eclipse.org/", "Microsoft Visual Studio": "https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/", or others.


!bc pycod-t
import sys, os
# Add the doconce installation directory to the path
HOME = os.getenv("HOME")
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(HOME, 'doconce/lib'))
# Load the doconce.py file
from doconce import doconce

# Format to html
os.chdir(os.path.join(HOME, 'doconce/test'))
sys.argv = ['doconce format', 'html', 'testdoc.do.txt','--html_output=temp','--execute']
doconce.format_driver()
sys.exit()  #stop execution here

# Create a jupyterbook
from doconce.jupyterbook import jupyterbook
os.chdir(os.path.join(HOME, 'doconce/test/mybook'))
sys.argv = ['doconce jupyterbook', 'jupyterbook.do.txt',
            '--sep=section', '--sep_section=subsection',
            '--dest=content','--dest_toc=.',
            '--titles=titles.txt', 
            '--allow_refs_to_external_docs']
jupyterbook()
print(os.system('jupyter-book build .'));
sys.exit()  #stop execution here

# Format to latex
os.chdir(os.path.join(HOME, 'doconce/test'))
sys.argv = ['doconce format', 'latex', 'execute.do.txt', 
            '--execute', 
            '--latex_font=helvetica', '--latex_code_style=pyg']
doconce.format_driver()
# Run a function in a py script
from doconce.misc import ptex2tex;
ptex2tex()
os.system('pdflatex -shell-escape execute.tex');
os.system('dvipdf execute.dvi');
os.system('xreader execute.pdf');
!ec

As an example for PyCharm, see the guide "Create and edit run/debug configurations﻿": "https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-and-editing-run-debug-configurations.html" to set up create and edit run/debug configurations﻿. I suggest using a virtual environment as "Python interpreter": "https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/python-interpreters.html".

======= Running Tests =======

Tests are written in the `test/` folder. See the instructions in the `README` file. 

New tests using `pytest` library are currently under development. They can be run with 

!bc pycod-t
pytest -v test_run.py
!ec

======= Compiling the documentation =======

The documentation is written as DocOnce `.do.txt` files in different folder inside `doc/src/`, for example `doc/src/manual/`, `doc/src/quickref/`, `doc/src/tutorial/`. These folders contains a `make.sh` file that can be run in `bash` to create documentation in  different formats: 

!bc shcod-t
bash make.sh
!ec

All relevant output files are copied to `doc/pub` for publication on the github website.
